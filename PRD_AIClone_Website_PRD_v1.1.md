# AIClone.ae – Website / Landing Page PRD (v1.1)

> Product: AIClone.ae

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines the **strategy, structure, content, and functional requirements** for the **AIClone.ae primary website**.

The first version of the site is a **single, long-form landing page** that acts as:

- Home page  
- Core sales page  
- Brand introduction  
- Waitlist / application funnel  

The goal is to get **qualified prospects** (founders, CEOs, influencers, elite salespeople) to either:

1. Apply for a **72‑hour Digital AI Twin engagement**, or  
2. Join the **waitlist** for a future slot.

This PRD is content‑heavy and detailed so it can be handed directly to:
- A web designer  
- A copywriter  
- A developer  
- An AI assistant helping with implementation  

and they will all have a shared, unified blueprint.

---

## 2. Product & Brand Overview

### 2.1 What is AIClone.ae?

AIClone.ae is a **premium, white‑glove service** based in Dubai that creates a **Digital AI Twin** of a client:

- A digital version of them that **looks like them** (avatar / video)
- **Sounds like them** (voice clone)
- **Thinks like them** (brain / knowledge extraction)

The service combines:

- A deep, human‑led **brain extraction session** (BIVV: Brain, Identity, Voice, Video)  
- Professional‑grade **voice cloning** (e.g. ElevenLabs)  
- High‑end **video avatar creation** (e.g. HeyGen)  
- A **72‑hour white‑glove process**, delivered in the client’s **villa, office, penthouse, or jet**

The outcome is a **Digital AI Twin** that can be used by:

- The client’s marketing team  
- Content editors  
- Ads specialists  
- Course and program creators  

to produce **ongoing content** without the client needing to record daily videos.

---

### 2.2 Core Promise (Offer in One Line)

> **We build your Digital AI Twin in 72 hours so you can grow your brand without recording again.**

Supporting themes:

- Productise your knowledge  
- Escape the “content treadmill”  
- Turn your identity into a scalable asset  

---

### 2.3 Brand Positioning

- **Category:** Digital AI Twin / Identity‑level content automation  
- **Location Advantage:** Built and delivered in Dubai for UAE‑based leaders  
- **Price Point:** From ~AED 25,000 for the initial 72‑hour engagement (do not list exact price yet; use “starts from” language)  
- **Perception:** Private, exclusive, **first‑class jet / Rolls‑Royce** level service  

We are **not**:

- A generic AI agency  
- A template avatar SaaS  
- A cheap “talking head” generator  

We are:

- **Clone artisans** for high‑value individuals  
- A fusion of **consulting, psychology, media, and AI**  

---

## 3. Target Audience & Pain Points

### 3.1 Primary Personas

1. **Funded Founder / CEO (Dubai)**
   - Runs a startup or scale‑up
   - Busy with investors, board meetings, operations
   - Knows content matters but hates the recording treadmill
   - Wants a personal brand that matches business performance

2. **Influencer‑Coach / Expert**
   - Has built an audience on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, or LinkedIn
   - Now sells coaching, courses, or high‑ticket services
   - Income depends on consistent posting and launches
   - Feels content burnout and wants leverage

3. **Elite Sales / Real Estate Performer**
   - High‑ticket closer (real estate, finance, luxury services)
   - Reputation and deal flow depend on visibility and trust
   - Wants polished video presence without wasting hours filming

4. **Thought Leader / Author / Speaker**
   - Has written books, frameworks, and IP
   - Wants to **productise knowledge** more intelligently
   - Needs evergreen teaching content without constant studio days

---

### 3.2 Core Pain Points to Address on Page

The landing page must explicitly call out:

1. **Content Treadmill Pain**
   - “If I don’t post X videos a day, my reach and revenue die.”
   - Constant pressure to feed the algorithm.
   - Filming, editing, scripting → time sink and mental burden.

2. **Productising Knowledge Pain**
   - “I’ve built up decades of experience. It’s stuck in my head or scattered across videos and PDFs.”
   - No clear system to package it into scalable products.
   - Not enough time to sit and structure it all.

3. **Time & Energy Pain**
   - Every recording day costs them energy and opportunity cost.
   - They want to focus on deals, teams, investments, not lights and cameras.

4. **Brand & Legacy Pain**
   - They know their story, frameworks and philosophy matter.
   - They want something to **outlive** their current workload and schedule.
   - They want to leave a legacy asset behind: a digital version of themselves.

5. **Technical / Complexity Pain**
   - Tried DIY tools, agencies, or internal teams.  
   - Never reached a seamless solution.  
   - “We tried to build a clone but failed” (PlugMedia example style).

The copy on the landing page must **mirror their inner dialogue** at least once in the early sections.

---

## 4. Brand Voice & Visual Direction

### 4.1 Brand Voice

- **Premium** – like a private bank or family office  
- **Bold** – honest about pain and ambition  
- **Authentic** – human‑sounding, not robotic or hypey  
- **Clear** – short sentences, no jargon, avoid generic “AI magic” fluff  

Do not be playful or childish. This is **not** a SaaS website with cartoons. It is **discreet and confident**.

### 4.2 Visual Language

Chosen palette (Option 3):

- Midnight Blue (primary) – authority, depth, trust  
- Soft Gold (accent) – luxury, premium value  
- Obsidian Black (neutral / background / contrast)

Visual mood:

- Private jet, penthouse, boardroom, villa scenes  
- Night‑time city lights (Dubai skyline)  
- Subtle gradients, no harsh neon or playful colours  

Imagery tone:

- Clean, cinematic, high‑contrast  
- Minimalist, no clutter  
- Use imagery that supports the idea of **time, scale, and identity** (e.g. reflections, mirrors, fractals, silhouettes).

---

## 5. Page Strategy – Overall Structure

The first version of AIClone.ae is a **single, long‑form landing page** with clear narrative flow:

1. **Hero** – “Digital AI Twin in 72 hours” + key promise + CTA  
2. **Social Proof / Credibility** – signals, logos, network positioning  
3. **Pain Amplification** – content treadmill, productise knowledge, time drain  
4. **Introduce the Digital AI Twin** – what it is, why it matters  
5. **BIVV Framework & 72‑Hour Process** – deep breakdown of Brain, Identity, Voice, Video  
6. **Who This Is For / Not For** – qualify visitors, create exclusivity  
7. **Use Cases & Scenarios** – founders, influencers, real estate, thought leaders  
8. **Experience & Logistics** – villa/office/jet, white‑glove service  
9. **Deliverables & Outcomes** – what they walk away with  
10. **Pricing Framing** – “Investment from…” and value stacking (no full price sheet)  
11. **Ethics, Safety & Confidentiality** – address AI clone fear and trust  
12. **Mini Founder Section** – who is behind this (link to full Founder page later)  
13. **FAQ** – 8–12 high‑value questions  
14. **Waitlist / Application Form** – primary lead capture  
15. **Final Scarcity CTA** – one client per 72 hours, limited slots  

---

## 6. Detailed Section‑by‑Section Requirements

Below is what each section must **say and do**. Copywriters can use this as a scaffold.

---

### 6.1 Hero Section

**Objective:** Immediately show:
- WHAT: Digital AI Twin  
- WHO: For high‑value leaders  
- WHEN: 72 hours  
- WHY: So they never need to record again  

**Elements:**

- Primary headline:  
  > Your Digital AI Twin in 72 hours.

- Subheadline (combination of promise + pain relief):  
  > Grow your brand without recording another video.

- Supporting line (one sentence):  
  > A private, white‑glove service in Dubai that captures your brain, voice and presence once, then lets your Digital AI Twin speak for you everywhere.

- Primary CTA button:  
  > Apply for Your Twin

- Secondary CTA:  
  > Join the Waitlist

- Microcopy under CTAs:  
  > One client per 72‑hour block. Limited availability.

- Visual:  
  - High‑end hero visual: either  
    - a subtle avatar vs real split, or  
    - a founder silhouette overlooking Dubai at night with interface overlays.  

---

### 6.2 Social Proof / Credibility Strip

**Objective:** Make the visitor think “this is legitimate” within 3 seconds.

- Placeholder for:  
  - Existing or future brand logos (e.g. Plugmedia, OrionFunded, etc.)  
  - “Built by the team behind [ImplementAI / Talent Bridge / etc.]”  
- Short line of copy:  
  > Backed by decades of executive consulting, recruitment, and AI implementation in Dubai.

Optional: testimonials will be added later; design space reserved.

---

### 6.3 Pain Section – The Content Treadmill & Productising Knowledge

**Objective:** Make them feel understood before talking about the solution.

Structure:

- Section headline example:  
  > Your business depends on your presence. Your schedule doesn’t.

- Then two columns / sets of bullets:

**Column A – Content Treadmill:**

- “If I don’t post X videos a day, my reach dies.”  
- “Every platform wants video. My calendar doesn’t.”  
- “Scripting, filming, retakes, editing… for a 60‑second clip.”

**Column B – Stuck Knowledge:**

- “I’ve built frameworks, methods, and IP over years. It’s all in my head or scattered across old files.”  
- “I want to productise my knowledge but never find the time to structure it properly.”  
- “My team keeps asking me for content. I keep saying ‘later’.”

Then a bridging paragraph:

> You are not lazy. You are not disorganised. You are simply at the stage where your **time is more valuable than your ability to be on camera every day**.

---

### 6.4 Solution Intro – What is a Digital AI Twin?

**Objective:** Define the product clearly and credibly.

Short definition:

> A Digital AI Twin is a high‑fidelity digital version of you – trained on your ideas, voice and on‑camera presence – that can create content, teach, and communicate on your behalf across platforms.

Sub‑bullets:

- It **speaks in your voice** (tone, pace, personality).  
- It **appears as you** in video, on demand.  
- It is **fed by your own frameworks, stories, and language**.  
- Your team can use it to scale your presence without asking you to record.

Small note about ethics:

> This is not a gimmick. It is a serious, controlled asset with strict confidentiality and ownership.

CTA (text link style):  
> See how we build it in 72 hours ↓ (scroll)

   - Your avatar is trained to be camera‑ready for different scenarios:  
     - Studio, office, home library, skyline, green screen  
   - We generate test clips together and refine look and feel.

5. **Assembly & Calibration (Day 3)**
