# Troubleshooting AI Access (ChatGPT Blocked)

**Issue:** ChatGPT or other AI tools return "blocked / unsafe / non-retrievable origin" when trying to scan `aiclone.ae`.

**Diagnosis:**
Our local code is **correctly configured** to allow bots:
1.  `robots.txt` allows all agents (`User-agent: *`) asking them only to avoid the `/admin/` folder.
2.  `index.html` does not contain any `noindex` meta tags.

**Root Cause:**
This error is generated by the **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** or **Security Settings** of your hosting provider (Hostinger). Hosting providers often block AI bots by default to prevent server overload or scraping.

## How to Fix on Hostinger

Please follow these steps in your Hostinger Control Panel (hPanel):

1.  **Log in to Hostinger.**
2.  Navigate to **Websites** > **Manage** (for aiclone.ae).
3.  Look for **Security** in the sidebar.
    *   Check for **"Bot Protection"** or **"IP Blocker"**.
    *   If you see **"Block AI Bots"** or similar, turn it **OFF**.
4.  Check **Cloudflare** (if active):
    *   If you are using Cloudflare (CDN), go to the Cloudflare dashboard.
    *   Go to **Security** > **Bots**.
    *   Ensure "Bot Fight Mode" is **OFF** or configured to allow "Verified Bots" (ChatGPT is a verifying bot).
5.  **Hotlink Protection:**
    *   Check if "Hotlink Protection" is enabled in Hostinger. Sometimes this blocks external tools from fetching assets.

## Validation

After making these changes in the hosting panel:
1.  Wait 15-30 minutes for settings to propagate.
2.  Ask ChatGPT to scan the URL again.
3.  If it still fails, check the **SSL Certificate** in Hostinger to ensure it is valid and active (HTTPS is required for "safe" access).
