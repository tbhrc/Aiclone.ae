## Deployment Notes

The website is a **single static HTML file** that can be deployed to any hosting provider:

- **No build step required** – uses CDN for Tailwind and Lucide
- **Form action** – needs to be connected to email service or Zoho CRM
- **Founder photo** – currently uses placeholder icon; replace with actual photo if available

### To Deploy:
1. Upload [Website/index.html](file:///c:/Users/TalentBridgeDubai/OneDrive%20-%20Talent%20Bridge%20HR%20Consultancy/Aiclone.ae/Website/index.html) to your hosting provider
2. Configure form submission (update `<form>` action attribute)
3. Optionally rename to [index.html](file:///c:/Users/TalentBridgeDubai/OneDrive%20-%20Talent%20Bridge%20HR%20Consultancy/Aiclone.ae/Website/index.html) at domain root
