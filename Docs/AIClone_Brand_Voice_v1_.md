## 2. Customer avatar profiles

<persona id="founder-ceo-primary">

### 2.1 Primary avatar, scale up founder or CEO

**Role focus:** Founder, co founder, managing director or CEO of a growing company.

**Demographics:** Age thirty two to fifty five, based in Dubai, typically active in sectors such as technology, consulting, finance, real estate, education, media, hospitality or specialised services.

**Context:**

- Has an internal marketing team or agency, but personal brand output depends entirely on their own time.
- Already visible in some channels but inconsistent and often delayed.

**Key pain points:**
- No time or mental energy to record content regularly.
- Feels pressure from team or market to “be more visible” but cannot sustain it.

- Knows that competitors with weaker expertise appear stronger online.
- Feels that media requests, conferences and opportunities are being missed.

**Key desires:**
- Consistent and high quality presence across channels without spending hours on camera.

<persona id="shared-psychographics">

### 2.4 Shared psychographics across avatars

- Ambitious, growth oriented, reputation sensitive.
- Time poor and opportunity rich.
- Curious and open to AI but cautious about privacy and reputation damage.
- Prefer to pay more for discretion and quality than experiment with cheap tools.
- Often already working with consultants, which normalises premium fees.

<section id="5-value-proposition-messaging">

## 5. Value proposition and messaging map

<messaging_core>

**Core value proposition:** We transform your lifetime of experience into a seventy two hour Digital AI Twin that scales your presence across Dubai automatically so you never have to record content again.

</messaging_core>

<messaging_benefits>

- Omnipresence, the client can be present across platforms while physically focusing on high value work.
- Consistency, messaging, tone and positioning remain coherent even when different team members are executing.
- Legacy, the client’s knowledge and story become a living digital asset, not just a forgotten slide deck or book.
- Status, being among the first in Dubai with a serious Digital AI Twin sends a strong signal to peers and competitors.

</messaging_benefits>

<messaging_emotional>

### 5.2 Emotional and identity based messaging

Examples of emotional lines that can be used across assets:

- Grow your brand without ever recording again.
- Let your ideas work while you sleep.
- Be in three places at once without boarding another flight.
- Turn your story into a living digital asset, not just a frozen biography.

</messaging_emotional>

<messaging_prestige>

<section id="6-business-model">

## 6. Business model outline

<business_model>

### 6.1 Revenue streams

- Front end revenue, high ticket fees for seventy two hour Digital AI Twin engagements across the three tiers.
- Mid term revenue, ongoing content creation, script generation and consulting retainers.
- Back end revenue, AI transformation projects and custom AI agents built around the twin, for example support bots, training agents, recruitment clones.

### 6.2 Capacity and throughput

With a strict one client per seventy two hours rule, a single senior consultant can practically handle eight to ten clients per month if scheduled tightly. In reality, five to eight per month allows quality and travel flexibility. As demand grows, additional consultants can be trained in the AIClone method.

### 6.3 Upsell pathway

1. Client completes a seventy two hour clone engagement.
2. Client starts using the twin in marketing and internal communication, sees impact.
3. AIClone and iMPLEMENTAi.ae propose automation and agent projects built around the twin.
4. Client agrees to retainers or project based work, expanding revenue per client.

<section id="7-financial-model-pricing">

## 7. Financial model and pricing rationale

<pricing_rationale>

### 7.1 Strategic pricing principles

- The service must feel premium and scarce, not like a commodity.
- The entry price must filter out non ideal clients.
- The higher tiers must feel like logical extensions of value, not arbitrary jumps.

### 7.2 Why AED twenty five thousand as a minimum

- Reflects the cost and value of three days of focused senior consulting and technical labour.
- Is comfortably within reach for founders and CEOs who are the correct fit.
- Creates a psychological gap between DIY tools and this experience.

### 7.3 Why tiers at forty five thousand and seventy five thousand

- These tiers map to deeper work and larger outputs, not just higher margins.
- They create an aspirational ladder for clients who start at tier one.
- They open the door to jet based experiences and deeper legacy work where price is not the main concern.

</pricing_rationale>

<financial_notes>

### 7.4 Indicative revenue scenarios

These are illustrative and not forecasts.

- Scenario one, three clients per month at an average fee of thirty five thousand, front end revenue around one hundred and five thousand dirhams.
- Scenario two, four clients per month at an average fee of forty thousand, front end revenue around one hundred and sixty thousand dirhams.
- If even a fraction of these clients convert into back end AI transformation projects, total revenue per client can reasonably extend into the one hundred and fifty to three hundred thousand dirham range over twelve to eighteen months.

</financial_notes>

<section id="8-competitors-benchmarks">

## 8. Competitor and benchmark overview

<competitors>

### 8.1 Types of alternatives in the market

- DIY AI avatar tools, typically web platforms where users can upload a selfie and type text to generate talking head clips. These tools are inexpensive and self service. They do not provide strategy, brain extraction or a luxury experience.
- Video production agencies, traditional agencies that film and edit content. They can produce beautiful visuals but still require the client to be present on set and do not create a reusable digital twin.
- Personal brand consultants and coaches, professionals who help with positioning, messaging and content strategy. They often stop at the strategy level and do not implement AI based delivery.
- International clone training programs, global offers that teach people to build clones using off the shelf tools. They sometimes offer done for you packages but are not based in Dubai and do not fly to villas or jets for three day immersions.

### 8.2 AIClone.ae strategic advantages

- Local presence in Dubai with cultural and market understanding.
- Clear, simple and strong promise built around seventy two hours.
- White glove, human led BIVV method that clients can feel and talk about.
- One client at a time scheduling that signals rarity.
- Ability to conduct the experience in high status locations, offices, penthouses, jets.
- Tight integration with a broader AI transformation offering via iMPLEMENTAi.ae.

</competitors>

<moat>

### 8.3 Moat summary

The moat is not the tools. The moat is the combination of:

- Methodology.
- Positioning.
- Market.
- Brand.
- Experience.
- Relationships.

A competitor could use similar tools but would struggle to replicate the combination of luxury positioning, deep interviewing expertise, local network and AI transformation backend.
