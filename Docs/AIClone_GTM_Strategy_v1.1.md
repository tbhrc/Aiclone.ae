## 1. Launch Narrative = The Public Clone

**Your first case study is you, David.**  
Let your audience **watch your clone being built**. Show the ethics, behind-the-scenes interviews, and struggles. This becomes the brand story.

|-------|----------|
| Vlog: Cloning Myself | LinkedIn, YouTube |
| Timeline Series | Notion/Blog |
| Clone vs Real (side-by-side) | Carousel format |
| Clip: My voice says this? | Reels & Shorts |

- **Scarcity-first** → 1 client per 72h = automatic waitlist  
- **Trust through transparency** → show behind the curtain  
- **Live the product** → your twin does demos, follow-ups  
- **Reputation as moat** → no SaaS pricing, no automation mass pitch
